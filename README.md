# CI/CD Pipeline Project with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline
# Overview

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) workflow built using AWS services. The goal was to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying an application with high efficiency and reliability.

The deployment environment is powered by AWS Elastic Beanstalk, while AWS CodeBuild handles the build process and AWS CodePipeline orchestrates the workflow. Artifacts generated during the build process are stored in Amazon S3 for secure and scalable storage.

# Architecture and Workflow

# Source Stage

Code changes are committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.

CodePipeline automatically detects the changes and triggers the pipeline.

# Build Stage

CodeBuild retrieves the source code and runs the build commands defined in the buildspec.yml file.

The build artifacts (compiled code, dependencies, etc.) are stored in Amazon S3.

# Deploy Stage

Elastic Beanstalk automatically deploys the latest build from S3.

The application is hosted in a scalable environment with load balancing and health monitoring.

# Automation

The entire process (from code commit to deployment) runs automatically, ensuring fast, consistent, and error-free releases.
